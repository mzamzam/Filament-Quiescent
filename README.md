# Filament-Quiescent

Code repository for filament research. 
The research started in 2024.

Quick Guidelines:
1. Run 1.0 to download the data.
2. Run 1.1.0 to find the appropriate coordinates for cropping the image.
3. Run 1.1 to save intensity, datetime, and angular separation. Saving images is optional.
4. You may skip 1.2 and proceed directly to 1.3 to obtain the coordinates of the prominence edge. 
   1.2 is used to generate a height-time plot without a fitting line or onset height information.
5. Run 1.4, 1.4.1, and 1.4.2 sequentially to determine the onset height and time, velocity, and acceleration.
6. Run 1.6 to generate a height-time plot with a fitting line and onset height information.
Note: Thereâ€™s no need to run 1.5 as it generates all plots in one code.
